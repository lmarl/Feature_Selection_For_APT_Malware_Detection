#  This script reduces from the original 20535 samples
#  to the final 19547.
#
#  It checks wether the dataset has a value of 0 imports, which is a wrong#  one, and if so removes them. Also four new samples were removed because#  they lacked a lot of data from the report.

#Remove those samples where no IMPORTs are found. That is odd and seem to occur due any error:

#Remove 4 specific samples with very few valid fields
