For malware, Virusshare packets were obtained using a torrent client from tracker http://tracker.virusshare.com:6969/

They were stored in a specific directory and the the 00_divideletras.sh script was run

This script extracted the virusShare malware and divided the huge list of thousands of files by the first letter if the MD5 (the file names were their MD5) 

Then the malware was filtered by type. The PE32 executables were moved to a directory and the rest to a different one  

For APTs the files were gathered manually and stored directly in their respective directories. These file were NOT ordered depending of the first letter of 
their MD5 as we did with generic malware
